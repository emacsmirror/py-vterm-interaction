* REPL Scripts
These are scripts intended to be run in the REPL by =py-vterm-interaction=. Each
script (except =utility.py=) should contain only one function of the
same name as the script file. All functions should not alter the
global state and have no observable side effects in the REPL. They can
only use standard python functionality.

Each function must take a file path as its first argument and write
its output as json to that path. All functions in =utility.py= are
available to call in each script without importing them. Among the is
~dump_json([path], [value])~.
